      <h2>Noise Cancelling</h2>
      <p>Noise-cancelling headphones were originally created for airplane pilots to improve their comfort on long flights, and the first consumer versions were also intended for travellers.</p>
      <p>The technology, known as active noise-cancellation (ANC), works by using microphones to pick up low-frequency noise and neutralise it before it reaches the ear. The headset generates a sound that's phase-inverted by 180 degrees to the unwanted noise, resulting in the two sounds cancelling each other out.</p>
      <h2>Comfortable</h2>
      <p>Designed by experts on the field of over 50 years, the RADIOPHON headphones are extremely comfortable and durable. Some headphone become irritating and cumbersome after a long time of wearing them, but our headphones are made of pure silicon, so it is just like wearing another layer of skin over your ears.</p>
      <h2>Affordable</h2>
      <p>Built with raw materials that are radily available, RADIOPHON makes the most affordable headphones available in the high-end market. You cannot find another one with the same sepcs that matches our price.</p>
